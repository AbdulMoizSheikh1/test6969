## Massive Convolution Engine ###

This project gives a implementation of a opensource matrix convolution
The design has two sub designs
A convolution engine and a distributed control memory controller
The engine is intended to be a small in size low in power and performance optimized. 
The project is presented to be highly parallelized and high in performance.
